> Read the [full article](https://threkk.medium.com/i-tested-the-node-js-test-runner-so-you-dont-have-to-958b11db46ef)!

## Getting started
The purpose of this repository is to dig in the code to see the differences between the different versions. However, if you want to run it:
```
# Install all the deps
pnpm install

# Run the different test suites.
pnpm run test:nodejs
pnpm run test:jest
pnpm run test:mocha
pnpm run test:vitest
```

Thanks to [Vitest basic examples](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/tree/main/examples/basic) for the inspiration for the tests.
